          The University of Abuja, commonly known as UniAbuja, is a federal
          university located in the Nigerian capital city of Abuja. Established
          on January 1, 1988, it is one of the youngest universities in Nigeria.
          The decision to establish the University of Abuja was made in response
          to the need for a tertiary institution in the then newly established
          capital city. The university was part of a broader agenda to
          decentralize higher education in Nigeria, ensuring access to quality
          education across different regions of the country. Classes officially
          commenced in 1990 with the admission of the first set of students.
          Initially, the university had three faculties: the Faculty of Arts,
          the Faculty of Science, and the Faculty of Social Sciences. Over time,
          the university expanded its academic offerings, adding more faculties
          and departments. Since its establishment, the University of Abuja has
          focused on providing excellent and affordable education to students
          from diverse backgrounds. It offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and
          specialized programs across numerous disciplines, including law,
          engineering, medicine, social sciences, arts, and management sciences.
          The university campus is situated in the Gwagwalada area of Abuja,
          covering a vast expanse of land that includes modern buildings,
          lecture halls, laboratories, libraries, and various student
          facilities. In recent years, the university has undergone significant
          infrastructural development to enhance the learning environment.
          UniAbuja has consistently strived for academic excellence and has
          gained recognition both nationally and internationally. The university
          has produced graduates who have excelled in various fields and made
          significant contributions to society. Today, the University of Abuja
          continues to grow and expand while maintaining its commitment to
          providing quality education and promoting research and innovation. It
          strives to contribute to national development by producing graduates
          who are equipped with the knowledge and skills needed to address
          societal challenges.

          Originally, the university had two campuses: the mini-campus located
          in Gwagwalada, Abuja, and the permanent site situated along Airport
          Road, Abuja. The mini-campus served as the main campus until the
          permanent site was completed. The development of the permanent site
          began shortly after the establishment of the university. The main
          campus is spread over a vast area and comprises various buildings that
          cater to the academic, administrative, and residential needs of the
          university community. Some of the prominent buildings on the main
          campus of the University of Abuja include:
